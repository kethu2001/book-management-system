### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kethu2001/book-management-system.git
cd book-management-system

Open a terminal and navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend/BookApi
```

Restore packages:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Start the API server:

```

> 💡 Test the API using Swagger UI at `http://localhost:5000/swagger`

---

### 3️⃣ Run the Frontend (Angular)

Open a **second terminal** and navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the dev server:
